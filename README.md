# ### 1. Analyze the Logo Design

By examining the logo in the provided attachment. The shape is daimond
### 2. Setup the React Project

Create a new React project if you haven't already. You can use Create React App for a quick setup:

```bash
npx @vite/latest
cd logo-design
npm start

```

### 3. Create a Component or default App.jsx 

- **Structure your component**: Use JSX to structure the logo's parts. You might use `<div>` elements for each part of the logo.

### 4. Styling with CSS

- **Positioning Elements**: I have used CSS positioning elements relative to each other. You can use techniques like Flexbox, Grid, or position properties (`absolute`, `relative`)
- **CSS File**: Create a separate CSS file for the logo styles,  Import this CSS file into your `App.js` component.
- **Exact Measurements**: Using the exact height, width, colors, and positions as noted from the logo analysis to style each element. For instance, if the logo uses specific color codes, ensure you use the same codes in q                            your CSS.
- **Responsiveness**: Consider how the logo will resize on different screens. Use responsive units like percentages, viewport width (`vw`), and viewport height (`vh`) where appropriate.


### Testing
**Testing**: Checking the logo in multiple browsers and screen sizes to ensure it maintains its form and aesthetic appeal across different platforms.


### 7. Review

- **Review**: Checking how closely it matches the original design and how it could be improved.
